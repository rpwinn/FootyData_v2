# Data Issues Documentation

This directory contains documentation for data completeness issues, API problems, and other data collection challenges encountered during the FootyData_v2 project.

## Purpose

- **Track Data Problems**: Document issues that affect data completeness or quality
- **Investigation Records**: Maintain detailed findings and root cause analysis
- **Resolution Tracking**: Track progress on fixing or working around issues
- **Knowledge Base**: Provide reference for future data collection efforts

## Structure

### Issue Documentation Format
Each issue should be documented with:
- **Issue ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `ISSUE-001`)
- **Date Discovered**: When the issue was first identified
- **Severity**: High/Medium/Low impact on data collection
- **Status**: Open/In Progress/Resolved/Workaround
- **Affected Endpoints**: Which API endpoints are impacted
- **Root Cause**: Technical investigation findings
- **Impact Assessment**: How this affects data completeness
- **Resolution Plan**: Steps to address or work around the issue

### File Naming Convention
- `ISSUE-XXX_[brief_description].md` - Individual issue reports
- `summary_[date].md` - Periodic summaries of all issues
- `templates/` - Templates for new issue documentation
