# TASK-002-03A: Full League Seasons Data Collection

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: TASK-002-03A
- **Created**: 2025-07-31
- **Status**: TODO
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Epic**: EPIC-002 (Create Staging Tables for API Data)
- **Dependencies**: TASK-002-03 (League Seasons Staging Table)

## 🎯 Objective
Collect league seasons data for all leagues from the leagues staging table. This task implements the full data collection strategy with proper error handling, rate limiting, and recovery mechanisms.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Load league seasons data for all leagues from leagues staging table
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for failed API calls
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Log progress and statistics during collection
- [ ] Verify data integrity after collection
- [ ] Document any leagues with failed data collection

## 🔍 Context
This task follows TASK-002-03 which established the league seasons staging table and ETL process. Now we need to collect the full dataset (~1,740 seasons across 107 leagues) with robust error handling for production use.

## 📝 Implementation Steps

1. **Create Full Collection Script**
   - [ ] Create `src/etl/load_league_seasons_data_full.py`
   - [ ] Read league IDs from `staging.leagues` table
   - [ ] Implement proper rate limiting (6-second delays)
   - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **Implement Error Handling Strategy**
   - [ ] Handle API errors (401, 404, 500, 429)
   - [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - [ ] Log failed leagues for manual investigation
   - [ ] Continue processing even if some leagues fail

3. **Add Progress Tracking**
   - [ ] Log progress every 10 leagues
   - [ ] Track success/failure statistics
   - [ ] Estimate remaining time
   - [ ] Save intermediate results

4. **Implement Recovery Mechanisms**
   - [ ] Create checkpoint system to resume from failures
   - [ ] Allow partial collection to be resumed
   - [ ] Implement data validation after collection

5. **Create Verification Script**
   - [ ] Create `src/verification/verify_league_seasons_full_collection.py`
   - [ ] Compare fresh API calls with stored data for sample leagues
   - [ ] Generate collection statistics report

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Collection Strategy:
- **Source**: Read league IDs from `staging.leagues` table
- **Target**: Load all league seasons data into `staging.league_seasons` table
- **Rate Limiting**: 6-second delay between API calls
- **Estimated Duration**: ~11 minutes (107 leagues × 6 seconds)

### Error Handling:
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts for transient failures
- **Skip Strategy**: Log failed leagues and continue
- **Recovery**: Checkpoint system to resume from last successful league

### Files to Create:
- `src/etl/load_league_seasons_data_full.py`
- `src/verification/verify_league_seasons_full_collection.py`
- `logs/league_seasons_collection_[timestamp].log`

### Dependencies:
- TASK-002-03 (League seasons staging table)
- Leagues staging table with all leagues
- FBR API client with rate limiting
- PostgreSQL database access

## 📊 Expected Results

### Success Metrics:
- **Target**: 107 leagues processed
- **Expected Seasons**: ~1,740 seasons
- **Success Rate**: >95% (allowing for some API failures)
- **Duration**: ~11 minutes

### Failure Handling:
- **Failed Leagues**: Logged for manual investigation
- **Partial Success**: Data collected for successful leagues
- **Recovery**: Ability to resume from last successful league

## 📚 Resources
- [League Seasons API Documentation](src/api/endpoint_documentation/league_seasons.md)
- [FBR API Client](src/api/fbr_client.py)
- [Leagues Staging Table](src/database/create_leagues_staging.sql)
- [League Seasons Staging Table](src/database/create_league_seasons_staging.sql)

## 🚧 Blockers
- Requires completion of TASK-002-03
- Requires stable API access for ~11 minutes

## 💡 Notes
This task implements production-ready data collection with proper error handling. The checkpoint system allows for recovery from interruptions, and the logging system provides visibility into the collection process.
