# TASK-002-05: Create League Standings Staging Table

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: TASK-002-05
- **Created**: 2025-07-31
- **Status**: TODO
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Epic**: EPIC-002 (Create Staging Tables for API Data)
- **Dependencies**: TASK-002-03 (League Seasons staging table)

## üéØ Objective
Create PostgreSQL staging table for league standings data and validate it with real API calls. This endpoint requires league IDs and season IDs from the league seasons endpoint.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] League standings staging table created in `staging` schema
- [ ] Table schema matches `/league-standings` API response structure
- [ ] Test script makes 2-3 API calls using league_id + season_id combinations
- [ ] SQL verification query retrieves exact same data as original API response
- [ ] All field mappings validated (data types, null handling, etc.)

## üîç Context
This task depends on TASK-002-03 (League Seasons staging table) because the `/league-standings` endpoint requires both `league_id` and `season_id` parameters. We'll use combinations from the league seasons table to test this endpoint.

## üìù Implementation Steps

1. **Review League Standings API Documentation**
   - [ ] Read `/league-standings` endpoint documentation
   - [ ] Analyze API response structure and field types
   - [ ] Identify required fields and data types

2. **Design League Standings Staging Table Schema**
   - [ ] Map API fields to database columns
   - [ ] Define appropriate PostgreSQL data types
   - [ ] Add standard audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
   - [ ] Define primary key and indexes

3. **Create SQL Script**
   - [ ] Write `src/database/create_league_standings_staging.sql`
   - [ ] Include table comments and field descriptions
   - [ ] Add appropriate indexes for performance

4. **FBR Client Setup and Verification**
   - [ ] Verify `FBRClient.get_league_standings()` method exists and works correctly
   - [ ] Test client method with real API calls (with league_id and season_id parameters)
   - [ ] Validate response structure matches API documentation
   - [ ] Confirm rate limiting is enforced (6-second delay between calls)
   - [ ] Test error handling with invalid league_id/season_id combinations

5. **Implement and Test**
   - [ ] Execute SQL script and verify table structure
   - [ ] Create test script `src/etl/test_league_standings_data.py`
   - [ ] Query league seasons table to get 2-3 league_id + season_id combinations
   - [ ] Use `FBRClient.get_league_standings(league_id, season_id)` to make API calls
   - [ ] Store API responses in staging table
   - [ ] Write SQL query to retrieve stored data
   - [ ] Compare original API responses with SQL query results
   - [ ] Verify data integrity and field mapping accuracy

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Configuration:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- **Schema**: `staging` (as defined in `config/config.yaml`)
- **Connection**: Using `psycopg2` with environment variables from `.env`
- **Table**: `staging.league_standings`

### API Endpoint:
- **URL**: `/league-standings`
- **Method**: GET
- **Required Parameters**: `league_id` (integer), `season_id` (string, optional)
- **Response**: Array of team standings with position, points, goals, etc.

### Files to Create:
- `src/database/create_league_standings_staging.sql`
- `src/etl/test_league_standings_data.py`

### Dependencies:
- PostgreSQL database access via `DATABASE_URL`
- League seasons staging table (TASK-002-03)
- API documentation from TASK-001
- FBR API client configuration (`src/api/fbr_client.py`)
- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file

### FBR Client Method:
- **Method**: `FBRClient.get_league_standings(league_id: int, season_id: Optional[str] = None)`
- **Parameters**: `league_id` (required int), `season_id` (optional string)
- **Returns**: `Dict[str, Any]` with league standings data
- **Rate Limiting**: 6-second delay between calls
- **Error Handling**: Returns `{"error": str(e)}` on failure

## üìö Resources
- [League Standings API Documentation](src/api/endpoint_documentation/league_standings.md)
- [League seasons staging table](src/database/create_league_seasons_staging.sql)
- [FBR API Client](src/api/fbr_client.py)

## üöß Blockers
- **API Partially Working**: The `/league-standings` endpoint works for international competitions but fails for club competitions
- **Server-side Issue**: The endpoint appears to be broken on the API provider side
- **Dependency**: Requires TASK-002-03 (League seasons staging table) to be completed first

## üí° Notes
This endpoint provides final standings data for leagues. The test script should include both completed seasons and current seasons to validate different data scenarios.

### API Response Structure Notes
The actual API response has two top-level fields:
1. `standings_type` - Single datapoint (can be stored as a column)
2. `standings` - Array of team standings data

**Design Decision**: Store `standings_type` as a column in the standings table rather than creating a separate table, since it's a single datapoint.

**Nested JSON**: The response also includes a `top_team_scorer` field with nested JSON containing the team's top scorer and goals scored. This will be stored as JSONB in the database.

**Team ID Discovery**: This endpoint is a potential source for team IDs that can be used for the teams endpoint integration. The API works for certain league IDs (1, 3, 5, 7) but fails for others (2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10).

**Working League IDs**: 1, 3, 5, 7 (tested successfully)
**Failing League IDs**: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 (500 Server Errors)

**Pattern Discovery**: 
- ‚úÖ **International competitions work**: World Cup (1), CONCACAF (3), OFC (5), AFC (7)
- ‚ùå **Club competitions fail**: Premier League (9), Champions League (8), La Liga (12), etc.
- ‚úÖ **Season support**: World Cup works with different years (2014, 2018, 2022)

**Implementation Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Staging table created and tested
- ‚úÖ Test script created and validated
- ‚úÖ API endpoint works for some league IDs
- ‚úÖ Can collect data for working league IDs
- ‚ùå API fails for major leagues (Premier League, Champions League, etc.)

**Future Potential**: When the API is working for club competitions, this endpoint will provide team IDs for each league/season combination, which could solve the team ID discovery problem for TASK-002-06.

**Current Value**: 
- ‚úÖ **International team IDs available**: 100+ team IDs from World Cup, CONCACAF, OFC, AFC
- ‚úÖ **Can test teams endpoint**: Use international team IDs to validate teams endpoint
- ‚ùå **Club team IDs unavailable**: Major leagues (Premier League, Champions League, etc.) are broken
