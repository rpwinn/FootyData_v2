# TASK-001: API Endpoint Documentation with Examples

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: TASK-001
- **Created**: 2025-07-31
- **Status**: TODO
- **Priority**: HIGH

## 🎯 Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for each FBR API endpoint with specific examples, response formats, and usage patterns to establish a solid foundation for the project.

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 15 FBR API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Each endpoint has a dedicated markdown file in `src/api/endpoint_documentation/`
- [ ] Examples include actual API calls and responses
- [ ] Documentation covers parameters, response formats, and error cases
- [ ] Integration with existing endpoint documentation structure

## 🔍 Context
We have basic endpoint documentation but need to systematically test and document each endpoint with real examples. This will serve as the foundation for all data collection work and help identify which endpoints are working vs broken.

## 📝 Implementation Steps
1. **Audit Current Documentation**
   - [ ] Review existing endpoint documentation in `src/api/endpoint_documentation/`
   - [ ] Identify which endpoints are already documented
   - [ ] List endpoints that need new documentation

2. **Create New Documentation for Each Endpoint**
   - [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for each of the 15 FBR API endpoints
   - [ ] Include real API call examples with parameters
   - [ ] Document response formats and data structures
   - [ ] Document known limitations and issues for each endpoint


## 🛠️ Technical Details
- **Files to Create/Modify**: 
  - `src/api/endpoint_documentation/*.md` (15 files)
  - `README.md` (endpoint status summary)
  - `PROJECT_PLAN.md` (update with findings)
- **Dependencies**: FBR API access, working authentication

## 📚 Resources
- [FBR API Documentation](https://fbrapi.com/documentation)
- [Existing endpoint documentation](src/api/endpoint_documentation/)
- [FBR API client](src/api/fbr_client.py)

## 🚧 Blockers
- None currently identified

## 💡 Notes
This task will establish the foundation for all subsequent data collection work. The documentation should be comprehensive enough that anyone can understand how to use each endpoint without needing to test it themselves.
